# Tech test

Simply a repository of technical tests I've attempted for future referral, or general [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) coding practices I want to document.

## Pre-requisites

You'll need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installed (ideally the latest version available) plus the [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) gem.

## Installation

Clone the repository, copying the project into a working directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cruikshanks/tech-tests.git
cd tech-tests
```

Then run the following command

```bash
bundle install
```

[Bundler](http://bundler.io/) will download everything needed for the project. Once complete you're good to go!

## Execution

Where possible [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) tests have been written to confirm the behaviour of the solutions.

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```
